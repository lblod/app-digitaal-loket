Requirement is a generic class representing any type of prerequisite that may be desired, needed or imposed as an obligation.

To illustrate the notion: the European Directive on services in the internal market defines requirement as any obligation, prohibition, condition or limit provided for in the laws, regulations or administrative provisions of the Member States or in consequence of case-law, administrative practice, the rules of professional bodies, or the collective rules of professional associations or other professional organisations, adopted in the exercise of their legal autonomy."""@en, "Requirement is a generic class representing any type of prerequisite that may be desired, needed or imposed as an obligation.

The response to an Information Requirement is an Evidence when the issuer of the response is an authoritative source (e.g. a Civil Registry providing data about a natural person for the provision of public service through the Single Digital Gateway). In other cases, the responses might not be issued by an authoritative source, but the issuer supports the responses with Evidences (or commits to support them timely, e.g. a self-declaration or a declaration of oath). The Information Requirement can require structured data or documents of any form. For structured data, the Requirement can use 'Concepts' to specify the structure and type of the data expected in the response.
