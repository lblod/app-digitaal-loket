## What's included?

This repository harvest two setups.  The base of these setups resides in the standard docker-compose.yml.

* *docker-compose.yml* This provides you with the backend components.  There is a frontend application included which you can publish using a separate proxy (we tend to put a letsencrypt proxy in front).
* *docker-compose.dev.yml* Provides changes for a good frontend development setup.
  - publishes the backend services on port 90 directly, so you can run `ember serve --proxy http://localhost:90/` when developing the frontend apps natively.
  - publishes the database instance on port 8890 so you can easily see what content is stored in the base triplestore
  - provides a mock-login backend service so you don't need the ACM/IDM integration.

## Running and maintaining

  General information on running and maintaining an installation

### Running your setup

#### system requirments
You'll need a beefy machine, with at least 16 GB of ram.

#### Running the dev setup
First install `git-lfs` (see <https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Installation>)
```
 # Ensure git-lfs is enabled after installation
  git lfs install

  # Clone this repository
  git clone https://github.com/lblod/app-digitaal-loket.git

  # Move into the directory
  cd app-digitaal-loket
```
To ease all typing for `docker-compose` commands, start by creating the following files in the directory of the project.
A `docker-compose.override.yml` file with following content:
```
version: '3.7'
```
And an `.env` file with following content:
```
COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:docker-compose.dev.yml:docker-compose.override.yml
```
##### If you start for the first time
The loket app is huge, and a lot of data is being intialized. We want to make sure you don't overload your machine too much doing this the first time.
It's an optional step, if you trust your machine is powerful enough, you can move on.
This step should only be done once.
First start virtuoso and let it setup itself
```
docker-compose up virtuoso
```
Wait for the logs

```
HTTP/WebDAV server online at 8890
Server online at 1111 (pid 1)
```
Stop the service, usually `ctrl+c`
Then run the migrations
```
drc up migrations
```
This will take a while. You may choose to monitor the migrations service in a separate terminal to and wait for the overview of all migrations to appear: `docker-compose logs -f --tail=100 migrations`. When finished it should look similar to this:

```
[2023-04-07 20:13:15] INFO  WEBrick 1.4.2
[2023-04-07 20:13:15] INFO  ruby 2.5.1 (2018-03-29) [x86_64-linux]
== Sinatra (v1.4.8) has taken the stage on 80 for production with backup from WEBrick
[2023-04-07 20:13:15] INFO  WEBrick::HTTPServer#start: pid=13 port=80
```

##### Normal start
This should be your go-to way of starting the stack.
```
docker-compose up # or 'docker-compose up -d' if you want to run it in the background
```
Always double check the status of the migrations `docker-compose logs -f --tail=100 migrations`
Wait for everything to boot to ensure clean caches.

Probably the first thing you'll want to do, is see wether the app is running correctly. The fastest way forward is creating a `docker-compose.override.yml` file next to the other `docker-compose.yml` files, and add
```
# (...)
  loket:
    ports:
      - 4205:80
```
This way, you can directly connect to a built version of the frontend on port `4205`. Note, you might have conflicts because the port is already busy.
you're free to change `4205` to whatever suits you.

Once the migrations have ran, you can start developing your application by connecting the ember frontend application to this backend.  See <https://github.com/lblod/frontend-loket> for more information on development with the ember application.


#### Running the regular setup

  ```
  docker-compose up
  ```

  The stack is built starting from [mu-project](https://github.com/mu-semtech/mu-project).

  OpenAPI documentation can be generated using [cl-resources-openapi-generator](https://github.com/mu-semtech/cl-resources-openapi-generator).

### Ingesting external data
#### Administrative units
Only the 'normal' (i.e. non-worship) administrative units are provided by default.
If you need to ingest the data for worship administrative units, you will need to ingest the data through deltas from:

  * [Organisations portal](https://organisaties.abb.vlaanderen.be)
    * Note: this app also has a development and qa environment available.
##### steps
  - The next steps assume `.env` file has been set, cf. supra.
  - Ensure the following configuration is defined in the `docker-compose.override.yml`
    ```
    op-public-consumer:
        environment:
          DCR_SYNC_BASE_URL: "https://organisaties.abb.vlaanderen.be"
          DCR_DISABLE_INITIAL_SYNC: "true"
          DCR_DISABLE_DELTA_INGEST: "true"
    update-bestuurseenheid-mock-login:
        entrypoint: ["echo", "Service-disabled to not confuse the service"]
    ```
  - `docker-compose up -d`
  - Ensure all migrations have run and the stack is started and running properly.
  - Extra step in case of a resync, run:
    ```
    docker-compose exec op-public-consumer curl -X POST http://localhost/flush
    docker-compose logs -f --tail=200 op-public-consumer
    ```
      - This should end with `Flush successful`.
  - Update `docker-compose.override.yml` with
    ```
      op-public-consumer:
        environment:
          DCR_SYNC_BASE_URL: "https://organisaties.abb.vlaanderen.be"
          DCR_DISABLE_INITIAL_SYNC: "false" # -> this changed
          DCR_DISABLE_DELTA_INGEST: "false" # -> this changed
      update-bestuurseenheid-mock-login:
        entrypoint: ["echo", "Service-disabled to not confuse the service"]
    ```
 - `docker-compose up -d`
 - This might take a while if `docker-compose logs op-public-consumer |grep success`
      Returns: `Initial sync http://redpencil.data.gift/id/job/URI has been successfully run`; you should be good.
      (Your computer will also stop making noise)
 - In `docker-compose.override.yml`, remove the disabled service
       ```
        update-bestuurseenheid-mock-login:
          entrypoint: ["echo", "Service-disabled to not confuse the service"]
       ```
       The mock-logins will be created when a cron job kicks in. You can control the moment it triggers by playing with the `CRON_PATTERN` variable.
       See the `README.md` of the related service for more options.

### Setting up the delta-producers related services

To make sure the app can share data, producers need to be set up. There is an intial sync, that is potentially very expensive, and must be started manually

#### producers mandatarissen/leidinggevenden/submissions

(Note: similar for other producers)

1. make sure the app is up and running, the migrations have run
2. in docker-compose.override.yml, make sure the following configuration is provided:
```
  delta-producer-background-jobs-initiator-mandatarissen: # or
    environment:
      START_INITIAL_SYNC: 'true'
```
3. `drc up -d delta-producer-background-jobs-initiator-mandatarissen`
4. You can follow the status of the job, through the dashboard

##### Deltas producer: extra considerations
###### Separate publication-triplestore
Due to performance issues, related to the high usage, a separate triplestore (virtuoso) has been introduced to offload the publication of the data.
This architectural change is currently under evaluation. The criteria for evaluation will be: the performance win vs the practical consequences of such change.

If deemed succesful, we might consider moving the remaining publication graphs to this triplestore too (mandatarissen and leidinggevenden).

As a consequence, producers using the separate triplestore, will also publish and host the json-diff files.
Mainly to simplify the transition to a separate publication triple store (else we would need a separate mu-auth and deltanotifier).
In essence, it takes over https://github.com/lblod/delta-producer-json-diff-file-publisher, although both can still be combined.

###### Sharing of attachments and other file data.
If files need to be shared over deltas (attachments, form-data, cached-files) you will need to set in a docker-compose.override.yml
```
#(...)
  delta-producer-publication-graph-maintainer-submissions:
    KEY: "foo-bar
```
This will needs to be set in the consuming stack too. See [delta-producer-publication-graph-maintainer](https://github.com/lblod/delta-producer-publication-graph-maintainer) for more informmation on the implications.

##### Additional notes

###### Performance (mandatarissen/leidinggevenden)
- The default virtuoso settings might be too weak if you need to ingest the production data. Hence, there is better config, you can take over in your `docker-compose.override.yml`
```
  virtuoso:
    volumes:
      - ./data/db:/data
      - ./config/virtuoso/virtuoso-production.ini:/data/virtuoso.ini
      - ./config/virtuoso/:/opt/virtuoso-scripts
```
###### delta-producer-report-generator
Not all required parameters are provided, since deploy specific, see [report-generator](https://github.com/lblod/delta-producer-report-generator)
###### deliver-email-service
Should have credentials provided, see [deliver-email-service](https://github.com/redpencilio/deliver-email-service)

### Upgrading your setup

Once installed, you may desire to upgrade your current setup to follow development of the main stack.  The following example describes how to do this easily for both the demo setup, as well as for the dev setup.

#### Upgrading the dev setup
For the dev setup, we assume you'll pull more often and thus will most likely clear the database separately:
```
# This assumes the .env file has been set. Cf. supra in the README.md
# Bring the application down
docker-compose down
# Pull in the changes
git pull origin master
# Launch the stack
docker-compose up
```
  As with the initial setup, we wait for everything to boot to ensure clean caches.  You may choose to monitor the migrations service in a separate terminal to and wait for the overview of all migrations to appear: `docker-compose logs -f --tail=100 migrations`.

  Once the migrations have ran, you can go on with your current setup.

### Cleaning the database

At some times you may want to clean the database and make sure it's in a pristine state.

```
# This assumes the .env file has been set. Cf. supra in the README.md
# Bring down our current setup
docker-compose down
# Keep only required database files
rm -Rf data/db
git checkout data/db
# Bring the stack back up
docker-compose up
```
Notes:
  - virtuoso can take a while to execute its first run, meanwhile the database is inaccessible. Make also sure to wait for the migrations to run.
  - data from external sources need to be synced again.

### POC LMB sync with Loket

We want to sync the data of mandatenbheer application with the information in the loket database. Therefor we are using some services to make this happen. All the information on how this is done and how it works can be found [here](./docs/poc-sync-mandatenbeheer-entities.md).
